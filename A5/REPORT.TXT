________________________________________________

Answer the following questions. Be concise and clear
but explain carefully when needed.

1 .- (5 marks) Describe briefly the different ways you researched for
	       measuring dissimilarity between probability distributions.


2 .- (2.5 marks) Describe the method you used to select a test for each
  	         node of a decision tree. Even if you used standard
	         'reduction of uncertainty', explain what other things
	         you tried and why did you choose to stay with your 
	         final setup.

3 .- Report the per/class classification rates for 

	Tree levels    :	4	7	4	7	4	7	4	7
	Number of trees:	10		50		100		150

     
4 .- Report the overall classification rates for

	Tree levels    :	4	7	4	7	4	7	4	7
	Number of trees:	10		50		100		150


5 .- (2.5 marks) Based on the above. Are deeper trees better or worse
		 at solving this task? should you keep adding levels to
		 the trees?

6 .- (2.5 marks) Based on the above. Are forests with more trees better?
		 should you keep adding trees to the forest?

7 .- (2.5 marks) What would have to change in your code if you were going to do
		 classification of all letters/symbols/digits instead of just
		 digits?
