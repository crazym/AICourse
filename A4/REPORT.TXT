Answer the following questions. Be concise and clear
but explain carefully when needed.

1 .- (1 marks) Train a 1-layer network using the Logistic activation
               function. 

	       Copy/paste the reported classification rates for:
	 	
	       Training data (last training round):

	       Testing data:

2 .- (1 marks) Repeat the process using the hyperbolic tangent activatiob
	       function.


3 .- (1 marks) Which type of activation function yielded the best classification
	       results? which one learned faster?

4 .- (1 marks) Train a 2-layer network with hyperbolic-tangent activation, using
	       150 hidden units. Report the classification rates on training and
	       testing data just as for 1) and 2).

5 .- (1 marks) Same as 4), except use 10 hidden units instead

6 .- (1 marks) Same as 5), except use 3 hidden units instead

7 .- (4 marks) Comment on the experiments in 4, 5, and 6, and give your conclusion
	       regarding the effect of the number of hidden units on classification
	       accuracy. 

	       What is the network with 3 hidden telling you about this classification
	       problem?

8 .- (5 marks) Train the best performing network you can. Use any activation function
	       you wish, and set the number of hidden units so as to achieve the best
	       performance.

	       Number of hidden units used:

	       Classification rate on testing data:

9 .- (5 marks) Describe how you would build a network to play the cat
	        and mouse game (move the mouse to help it survive).

		- Describe what the input is in terms of a vector of
		  values
		- Describe what the output layer looks like (how many
		  neurons and what they encode)
		- Describe the error function
		- How many layers should you use?

Mark with an 'x' where appropriate. If something is only
working partially, briefly describe what works, what
doesn't work, or what problems exist.
