3 .- (1 marks) Which type of activation function yielded the best classification
	       results? which one learned faster?

4 .- (1 marks) Train a 2-layer network with hyperbolic-tangent activation, using
	       150 hidden units. Report the classification rates on training and
	       testing data just as for 1) and 2).

	       Training data (last training round):
	       
	       Testing data:


5 .- (1 marks) Same as 4), except use 10 hidden units instead

	       Training data (last training round):
	       
	       Testing data:

6 .- (1 marks) Same as 5), except use 3 hidden units instead

	       Training data (last training round):
	       
	       Testing data:

7 .- (4 marks) Comment on the experiments in 4, 5, and 6, and give your conclusion
	       regarding the effect of the number of hidden units on classification
	       accuracy. 

	       What is the network with 3 hidden telling you about this classification
	       problem?

8 .- (5 marks) Train the best performing network you can. Use any activation function
	       you wish, and set the number of hidden units so as to achieve the best
	       performance.

	       Number of hidden units used:
	       150
	       Classification rate on testing data:
	       0.996722

9 .- (5 marks) Describe how you would build a network to play the cat
	        and mouse game (move the mouse to help it survive).

		- Describe what the input is in terms of a vector of
		  values

Input should be different states of the game (i.e. just like QLearning - positions of the agents including cats, mouses, and cheeses)

		- Describe what the output layer looks like (how many
		  neurons and what they encode)

4 neurons that represents 4 directions of movement (up, right, down, left), the output value should represent the goodness of that move based on input configuration.

		- Describe the error function

The error function would be the differences between the target value and goodness of the move, the target value should be set positive for movement good to the mouse and negative for movement bad for the mouse.

		- How many layers should you use?

Since there is a large number of inputs, it would be great to have hidden layers that extract the input features. I think 1-2 hidden layers that extract input features regarding the positions of cheese, cat and mouse should be great.
